# Wave Function Collapse

[Wave function collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) implementation in Haskell.

This implementation works on a "Graph" rather than an image, so it scales to arbitrary dimensions. This means you can run WFC in 2D, 3D, or even do 3D animations over time: 4D! If you can express relationships between "cells" in your space you can solve it.

This lib is in early stages and will be changing a lot.

## Example

Building a simple tiling pattern with WFC using a text grid:
